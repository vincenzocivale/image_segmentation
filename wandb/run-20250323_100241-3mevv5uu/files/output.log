Some weights of Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/mask2former-swin-base-coco-instance and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- class_predictor.bias: found shape torch.Size([81]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([5]) in the model instantiated
- class_predictor.weight: found shape torch.Size([81, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([5, 256]) in the model instantiated
- criterion.empty_weight: found shape torch.Size([81]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([5]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
